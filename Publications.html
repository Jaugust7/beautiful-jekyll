  <p>Chromatin modifiers act to coordinate gene expression changes critical to neuronal differentiation from neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Histone methyltransferase KMT2D promotes transcriptional activation and its loss causes the intellectual disability disorder Kabuki syndrome 1 (KS1) in ways that are not well understood. We conducted parallel studies of proliferation, differentiation, and transcription and chromatin profiling in KMT2D-deficient human and mouse models of brain development to define KMT2D-dependent functions in neurodevelopmental contexts, including adult-born hippocampal NPCs in vivo. We report cell-autonomous proliferation, cell cycle progression, and survival deficits accompanied by transcriptional perturbance of oxygen-sensing, central carbon metabolism, and mRNA/protein metabolism pathways, with functional experiments demonstrating disruption of KMT2D-dependent hypoxia responses and proteasome functions. Importantly, signatures of precocious neuronal differentiation accompanied defects in NPC maintenance. Together, our findings support a model in which KMT2D loss causes transcriptional suppression of metabolic programs for NPC maintenance, resulting in exhaustion of precursors required for adult hippocampal neurogenesis.</p>

  <p>Chromatin modifiers act to coordinate gene expression changes critical to neuronal differentiation from neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs). Lysine-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) encodes a histone methyltransferase that promotes transcriptional activation and is frequently mutated in cancers and in the majority (>70%) of patients diagnosed with the congenital, multisystem intellectual disability disorder Kabuki syndrome 1 (KS1). Critical roles for KMT2D are established in various non-neural tissues, but the effects of KMT2D loss in brain cell development have not been described. We conducted parallel studies of proliferation, differentiation, transcription, and chromatin profiling in KMT2D-deficient human and mouse models to define KMT2D-regulated functions in neurodevelopmental contexts, including adult-born hippocampal NSPCs in vivo and in vitro. We report cell-autonomous defects in proliferation, cell cycle, and survival, accompanied by early NSPC maturation in several KMT2D-deficient model systems. Transcriptional suppression in KMT2D-deficient cells indicated strong perturbation of hypoxia-responsive metabolism pathways. Functional experiments confirmed abnormalities of cellular hypoxia responses in KMT2D-deficient neural cells and accelerated NSPC maturation in vivo. Together, our findings support a model in which loss of KMT2D function suppresses expression of oxygen-responsive gene programs important to neural progenitor maintenance, resulting in precocious neuronal differentiation in a mouse model of KS1.</p>

  <!--DPY30 Sox2-->
  <p>Epigenetic mechanisms, including histone modifications, have emerged as important factors influencing cell fate determination. The functional role of H3K4 methylation, however, remains largely unclear in the maintenance and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)/hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Here we show that DPY30, a shared core subunit of the SET1/MLL family methyltransferase complexes and a facilitator of their H3K4 methylation activity, is important for ex vivo proliferation and differentiation of human CD34(+) HPCs. DPY30 promotes HPC proliferation by directly regulating the expression of genes critical for cell proliferation. Interestingly, while DPY30 knockdown in HPCs impaired their differentiation into the myelomonocytic lineage, it potently promoted hemoglobin production and affected the kinetics of their differentiation into the erythroid lineage. In an in vivo model, we show that morpholino-mediated dpy30 knockdown resulted in severe defects in the development of the zebrafish hematopoietic system, which could be partially rescued by coinjection of dpy30 messenger RNA. Taken together, our results establish a critical role of DPY30 in the proliferation and appropriate differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells and in animal hematopoiesis. Finally, we also demonstrate a crucial role of DPY30 in the growth of several MLL1-fusion-mediated leukemia cell lines.</p>
