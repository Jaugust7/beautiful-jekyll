# Jonathan Augustin's Webpage

This webpage is dedicated to hosting my CV and list of publications as well as developing blogs based around research topics I'm interested (including data analysis where possible). The primary purpose of maintaining this site is to teach myself how to maintain a webpage, how to write good markdowns, and how to write engaging stories centered around scientific research. This site was created using <a href="http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll">
beautiful jekyll </a> as a template.
